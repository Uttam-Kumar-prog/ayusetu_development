## Feature-by-Feature: How It Works + Use Cases

### 1) Authentication and User Roles

What it does:
- Allows registration/login with role-specific flows (`patient`, `doctor`, `pharmacy`; admin access for system operations).
- Stores JWT token in frontend localStorage (`token`) for protected API calls.

How to use:
- Open Login/Register page.
- Authenticate and continue to role-appropriate dashboard/pages.

Use cases:
- Patient signs in to submit symptoms and book appointments.
- Doctor signs in to manage appointments and case details.
- Admin signs in to verify doctor accounts and monitor system health.

### 2) Symptom Assessment and Triage

What it does:
- Accepts symptom list + severity + lifestyle data.
- Runs rule-driven triage and returns:
  - dosha imbalance signal
  - severity level
  - urgency
  - recommended specialty
  - recommendation items (home remedy + Ayurvedic reasoning)

How to use:
- Patient goes to symptom input flow.
- Selects symptoms and severity.
- Adds profile/lifestyle and natural language details.
- Gets report-style output in UI.

Use cases:
- User with mild headache gets lifestyle/home remedy guidance.
- High-severity user receives warning and gets pushed toward doctor consultation.

### 3) AI Chat Assistant (AyuBot)

What it does:
- Conversational assistant for symptoms, guidance, booking navigation, and escalation.
- Supports quick actions (doctor talk, symptom guidance, booking, account help, routine tips, assistant naming).

How to use:
- Open chatbot widget from launcher.
- Chat in natural language.
- Use guided cards/workflows for structured symptom assessment and booking.

Use cases:
- Patient types: "I have severe headache and anxiety since morning".
- Assistant guides to report flow and if severe, prompts urgent doctor booking.

### 4) Prescription/Report Upload Analysis (Server-side)

What it does:
- Uploads previous prescription/report files to backend endpoint.
- Extracts text and structured health signals from:
  - text-like files (`txt`, `json`, `csv`, `md`)
  - PDFs (text parse)
  - images (OCR via OpenAI Vision when API key configured)
- Asks follow-up "how do you feel now" and can generate fresh triage report.

How to use:
- In chatbot, select upload flow or paperclip attachment.
- Upload report/prescription.
- Provide follow-up current feeling.
- Generate report.

Use cases:
- Returning patient uploads old prescription + says symptoms are now worse.
- System boosts risk sensitivity, provides warning/remedy guidance, and prompts doctor booking.

### 5) Longitudinal Symptom Memory

What it does:
- Stores recurring symptom signals captured from:
  - chat messages
  - upload-analysis flows
  - formal symptom assessments
- Computes "top recurring symptoms" and "likely contributors".
- Reuses memory for future guidance and doctor case context.

How to use:
- Patient chats naturally over multiple sessions.
- On return, chatbot memory panel can show recurring patterns.

Use cases:
- A patient repeatedly reports fatigue + insomnia.
- Future sessions immediately start with personalized context and better recommendations.

### 6) Doctor Discovery, Availability, and Booking

What it does:
- Lists doctors and profile details.
- Reads doctor availability slots.
- Books appointments with slot locking to avoid double booking.

How to use:
- Patient opens doctor list/profile.
- Chooses specialty, doctor, date, and time.
- Confirms appointment.

Use cases:
- Patient triage suggests `Kayachikitsa`; patient books first available relevant doctor.

### 7) Doctor Dashboard + Case Report

What it does:
- Doctor sees appointments and updates status (`CONFIRMED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, etc.).
- Doctor can open case report modal containing:
  - appointment summary
  - recent symptom assessments
  - symptom memory (top symptoms, likely causes, conversation signals)

How to use:
- Doctor logs in, opens dashboard.
- Clicks `Case Report` for any appointment.
- Reviews context before call and records notes.

Use cases:
- Doctor sees recurring anxiety + insomnia context before consultation starts.

### 8) Prescriptions, Therapy, Pharmacy

What it does:
- Digital prescription creation and retrieval.
- Therapy plan/session tracking.
- Pharmacy inventory updates and medicine search.

How to use:
- Relevant role dashboards/pages call these APIs.

Use cases:
- Doctor updates therapy session progress.
- Pharmacy verifies medicine availability and updates stock.

### 9) Admin and Analytics

What it does:
- Doctor verification queue for safe onboarding.
- System health endpoint and trend analytics.

How to use:
- Admin views pending doctors and approves/rejects.
- Admin checks trend dashboards for operational planning.

Use cases:
- Operations team observes district trend shifts and allocates doctor availability.

## AI Assistant (AyuBot) Detailed Flow

### Standard Symptom Guidance Flow

1. Patient starts chat
2. Selects symptoms
3. Sets severity for each symptom
4. Enters profile/lifestyle details
5. Adds natural language description
6. Gets report card with remedy and Ayurvedic explanation
7. If any severity is high/severe:
   - warning displayed
   - doctor consultation CTA shown

### Upload + Follow-up Flow

1. Upload old prescription/report
2. Backend extracts and detects symptom/medication signals
3. Assistant asks follow-up about current condition
4. Patient responds in NLP + feeling state
5. New triage report generated and stored
6. Memory updated for future sessions

### Personalized Assistant Name Flow

- If patient says "Call you Alex", session stores assistant name.
- Future chat header/replies can continue with that preferred name.

  - `vercel-build`
- `backend/package.json`
  - `vercel-build`

### 1) Deploy backend project on Vercel

1. In Vercel dashboard, create new project from this repo.
2. Set **Root Directory** to `backend`.
3. Framework preset: `Other`.
4. Build command: `npm run vercel-build`.
5. Output directory: leave empty.
6. Add environment variables:
   - `MONGO_URI`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
   - `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`
   - `CORS_ORIGIN` (set later to frontend domain)
   - `WEB_URL` (frontend domain)

   - Optional: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
7. Deploy and copy backend URL, for example:
   - `https://ayu-backend.vercel.app`

Health check after deploy:
- `https://ayu-backend.vercel.app/health`

### 2) Deploy frontend project on Vercel

1. Create another Vercel project from same repo.
2. Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`.
3. Framework preset: `Vite`.
4. Build command: `npm run vercel-build`.
5. Output directory: `dist`.
6. Add environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL=https://<your-backend-domain>/api`
7. Deploy and copy frontend URL, for example:

### 3) Final CORS and web URL update

After frontend deploy, update backend environment variables:
- `CORS_ORIGIN=https://<your-frontend-domain>`
- `WEB_URL=https://<your-frontend-domain>`

Redeploy backend once after updating these values.

### 4) Verify production flow

- Open frontend URL.
- Register/login.
- Check symptom submission.
- Check chatbot API calls.
- Check doctor list and appointment APIs.

## API Overview

Detailed backend endpoint reference is in:
- [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)

High-use endpoints:
- Auth: `/api/auth/*`
- Symptoms: `/api/symptoms/*`
- Chats: `/api/chats/*`
- Doctors: `/api/doctors/*`
- Appointments: `/api/appointments/*`
- Prescriptions/Therapy/Pharmacy/Admin/Analytics modules available as documented

## Roles and Access Control

Main roles:
- `patient`
- `doctor`
- `pharmacy`
- `admin`

Authorization is enforced in middleware per route.

## Operational Notes and Safety

- Response shape is generally consistent (`{ success, message?, ...data }`).
- Keep frontend calls centralized in `frontend/src/utils/api.js`.
- Token must exist in localStorage key `token` for protected endpoints.
- For high-severity symptoms, always prefer immediate doctor consultation.
- AI guidance is supportive, not a substitute for emergency or definitive medical diagnosis.

## Testing and Verification Checklist

Before release:
- Backend starts and DB connects
- Frontend production build succeeds
- Auth/login persistence works
- Chat message send/receive works
- Upload analyze endpoint works with at least one text/PDF/image sample
- Report generation works from both symptom flow and upload flow
- Doctor case report modal displays memory + recent assessments

## Current Limitations and Next Improvements

- Scanned-image PDFs may need enhanced OCR pipeline for best extraction quality.
- Expand symptom ruleset and multilingual symptom aliasing.
- Add stronger automated tests (unit + API integration + e2e).
- Add audit/history UI for case-report timeline filtering.
